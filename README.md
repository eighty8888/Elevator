This is just code for elevators and how they operate. It takes into account weight and the space occupied of the elevator. Was just wondering how they know which floor to go to, and I supposedly chose the simplest algorithm that most elevators follow, I think. Put simply, when someone enters a direction before entering the elevator (up or down), the elevator will continue to move in that direction, picking up people as it goes. Anyone who, for some reason, wants to go down on an elevator going up, the elevator will keep going up until the highest floor is reached and then proceed downwards to their desired floor.
